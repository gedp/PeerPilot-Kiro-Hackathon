# PeerPilot Document Processing - Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the PeerPilot document processing system, focusing on automated text extraction from academic papers using Amazon Textract.

## User Stories

### US-001: Document Upload and Processing
**As a** journal editor  
**I want to** upload PDF documents to the system  
**So that** they can be automatically processed for text extraction and analysis  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System accepts PDF files uploaded to S3 bucket `peerpilot-kiro-data/input-articles/`
- Processing is triggered automatically upon file upload
- System handles both single-page and multi-page documents
- Maximum file size: 500MB per document
- Supported formats: PDF only for initial version

### US-002: Text Extraction
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** reliable text extraction from uploaded PDFs  
**So that** the content can be analyzed for compliance and reviewer matching  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Text extraction accuracy ≥ 95% for standard academic papers
- System automatically chooses optimal extraction method (sync vs async)
- Extracted text is stored in `peerpilot-kiro-data/extracted-texts/` with same base filename
- Extraction metadata is saved alongside text files
- System handles documents in English, Spanish, German, Italian, French, and Portuguese
- Confidence scores are captured and stored for quality assessment

### US-003: Error Handling and Recovery
**As a** system operator  
**I want** robust error handling during document processing  
**So that** failures are logged and can be investigated  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Failed extractions are logged with detailed error information
- Error metadata is stored in S3 for troubleshooting
- System attempts fallback extraction methods when primary method fails
- Processing continues for other documents even if one fails
- Retry mechanism for transient failures

### US-004: Processing Status and Monitoring
**As a** journal editor  
**I want to** monitor the status of document processing  
**So that** I know when documents are ready for review  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Processing status is tracked and stored
- Completion notifications are available
- Processing time is logged for performance monitoring
- System provides list of processed documents
- Metadata includes processing timestamps and method used

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Document Input
- System must accept PDF documents via S3 upload
- Trigger processing automatically on S3 ObjectCreated events
- Support documents up to 500MB in size
- Handle multi-page documents efficiently

### FR-002: Text Extraction Engine
- Integrate Amazon Textract for OCR and text extraction
- Implement intelligent method selection:
  - Use synchronous detection for documents < 5MB
  - Use asynchronous detection for documents ≥ 5MB or multi-page
- Extract plain text content preserving document structure
- Capture confidence scores for quality assessment

### FR-003: Output Management
- Store extracted text in structured format (UTF-8 plain text)
- Generate extraction metadata in JSON format
- Use consistent naming convention: `{original_name}.txt` and `{original_name}.json`
- Store outputs in organized S3 folder structure

### FR-004: Error Management
- Implement comprehensive error handling for all processing steps
- Log errors with sufficient detail for troubleshooting
- Store error information in structured format
- Provide fallback mechanisms for common failure scenarios

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Performance
- Process single-page documents within 30 seconds
- Process multi-page documents within 5 minutes
- Support concurrent processing of multiple documents
- Optimize for cost-effective AWS resource usage

### NFR-002: Reliability
- System availability: 99.5%
- Error rate: < 1% for standard academic papers
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### NFR-003: Scalability
- Handle up to 100 documents per hour
- Auto-scale based on processing demand
- Efficient resource utilization during peak loads
- Support for future volume growth

### NFR-004: Security
- Secure document storage with encryption at rest
- Access control for S3 buckets and Lambda functions
- Audit logging for all processing activities
- Compliance with data protection requirements

### NFR-005: Maintainability
- Modular code architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Automated testing for critical functionality
- Clear documentation for deployment and operations

## Technical Constraints

### TC-001: AWS Services
- Must use Amazon Textract for text extraction
- Must use Amazon S3 for document storage
- Must use AWS Lambda for serverless processing
- Must operate within AWS service limits and quotas

### TC-002: Programming Language
- Implementation in Python 3.12
- Use of boto3 SDK for AWS service integration
- Follow PEP 8 coding standards

### TC-003: Data Formats
- Input: PDF documents only
- Output: UTF-8 plain text and JSON metadata
- Structured logging in JSON format

## Integration Requirements

### IR-001: S3 Integration
- Seamless integration with existing S3Client
- Consistent error handling across S3 operations
- Efficient file transfer and storage management

### IR-002: Lambda Integration
- Integration with existing Lambda function architecture
- Proper event handling for S3 triggers
- Efficient resource utilization within Lambda limits

### IR-003: Monitoring Integration
- CloudWatch logging integration
- Performance metrics collection
- Error rate monitoring and alerting

## Acceptance Criteria Summary

The system is considered complete when:
1. All user stories are implemented and tested
2. Functional requirements are met with documented test results
3. Non-functional requirements are validated through performance testing
4. Integration requirements are verified through end-to-end testing
5. Error handling scenarios are tested and documented
6. System documentation is complete and up-to-date
