# PeerPilot Document Processing Pipeline - Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive document processing pipeline for the PeerPilot system. The pipeline automates the ingestion, text extraction, and analysis of academic papers using AWS serverless services. The system processes PDF documents uploaded to Amazon S3, extracts text using Amazon Textract with intelligent method selection, and stores structured results for further analysis and reviewer matching.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Upload and Processing

**User Story:** As a journal editor, I want to upload PDF documents to the system, so that they can be automatically processed for text extraction and analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF is uploaded to `s3://peerpilot-kiro-data/input-articles/` THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger processing
2. WHEN processing starts THEN the system SHALL validate document format and size (max 500MB)
3. WHEN a document is valid THEN the system SHALL proceed with text extraction
4. IF a document is invalid THEN the system SHALL log the error and store error metadata
5. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL store results in structured S3 folders

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Text Extraction

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable text extraction from uploaded PDFs, so that the content can be analyzed for compliance and reviewer matching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is < 5MB THEN the system SHALL use synchronous Textract processing
2. WHEN a document is ≥ 5MB THEN the system SHALL use asynchronous Textract processing
3. WHEN text extraction completes THEN the system SHALL achieve ≥ 95% accuracy for standard academic papers
4. WHEN extraction finishes THEN the system SHALL calculate confidence statistics and quality metrics
5. WHEN results are ready THEN the system SHALL store extracted text in `extracted-texts/` folder

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Error Handling

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want robust error handling during document processing, so that failures are logged and can be investigated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extraction fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. WHEN all retries fail THEN the system SHALL store detailed error information in `processing-errors/`
3. WHEN timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle async job timeouts (max 5 minutes)
4. WHEN processing other documents THEN the system SHALL continue despite individual failures
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide structured error data for debugging

### Requirement 4: Structured Result Storage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want structured storage of processing results, so that downstream systems can easily access extracted content and metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text extraction completes THEN the system SHALL store plain text in `extracted-texts/{filename}.txt`
2. WHEN processing finishes THEN the system SHALL store metadata in `extraction-metadata/{filename}.json`
3. WHEN storing metadata THEN it SHALL include confidence scores, processing time, and extraction method
4. WHEN naming files THEN the system SHALL use consistent naming conventions based on original filename
5. WHEN organizing results THEN the system SHALL maintain clear folder structure for different data types

### Requirement 5: Processing Status and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a journal editor, I want to monitor the status of document processing, so that I know when documents are ready for review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing starts THEN the system SHALL track processing status and timestamps
2. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL provide detailed processing summaries
3. WHEN viewing results THEN the system SHALL show processing time, confidence scores, and quality metrics
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and resolution guidance
5. WHEN monitoring system THEN comprehensive logs SHALL be available for debugging and optimization
