# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables an AI agent Python project to integrate with Amazon S3 for file storage operations. The integration will provide secure upload and download capabilities using a dedicated S3 bucket named `peerpilot-kiro-data`. The system will handle AWS credential management and provide a clean interface for file operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure AWS credentials for S3 access, so that my AI agent can authenticate with AWS services securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL check for AWS credentials in environment variables or AWS credential files
2. IF AWS credentials are not found THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with setup instructions
3. WHEN valid AWS credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL successfully authenticate with AWS S3 service
4. IF invalid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL raise appropriate authentication errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create and configure the S3 bucket, so that my AI agent has a dedicated storage location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL check if the `peerpilot-kiro-data` bucket exists
2. IF the bucket does not exist THEN the system SHALL create it with appropriate permissions
3. WHEN the bucket is created THEN it SHALL be configured with proper access policies
4. IF bucket creation fails due to permissions THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to upload files to S3, so that I can store data persistently in the cloud.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file upload is requested THEN the system SHALL validate the file exists locally
2. WHEN uploading a file THEN the system SHALL use the file's original name as the S3 key by default
3. WHEN upload is successful THEN the system SHALL return the S3 object URL or key
4. IF upload fails THEN the system SHALL raise appropriate exceptions with error details
5. WHEN uploading THEN the system SHALL support custom S3 key names for organization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to download files from S3, so that I can retrieve stored data for processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file download is requested THEN the system SHALL validate the S3 key exists
2. WHEN downloading a file THEN the system SHALL save it to a specified local path
3. WHEN download is successful THEN the system SHALL return the local file path
4. IF the S3 object does not exist THEN the system SHALL raise a not found exception
5. IF download fails THEN the system SHALL raise appropriate exceptions with error details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple Python interface for S3 operations, so that I can easily integrate file storage into my AI agent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the S3 client THEN it SHALL provide methods for upload, download, and list operations
2. WHEN initializing the client THEN it SHALL handle AWS credential configuration automatically
3. WHEN performing operations THEN the client SHALL provide clear success/failure feedback
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the client SHALL provide meaningful error messages and suggested solutions
5. WHEN listing files THEN the client SHALL return file metadata including size and last modified date
